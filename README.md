## Motivation
This portfolio website showcases my skills and experience in UI/UX design. As a designer, having a well-designed portfolio website that reflects my skills is crucial today. Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself by coding the website myself to demonstrate my ability to work with developers and other departments in the future.

## Process
I desined wireframes and prototypes using Adobe Xd. After finalizing the design, I started the development phase, building the site with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

I used Bootstrap for the layout and responsive viewports, allowing me to create a mobile-first responsive website with two viewports: one for mobile screens and another for desktop screens with a minimum width of 576px

I thoroughly tested my website across various screen sizes and devices during the development process.

Challenge and Solution
I wanted to use a video as the main banner of the homepage, but it was not easy to make it responsive. However, I was able to resolve this issue by using the vw and vh units.

The screen overflowed, creating a horizontal scroll. It is resolved by 'Overflow:hidden'

It was difficult to do the animation effect that appears when scrolling down only with CSS, but it was processed easily using the javascript library.

## Learned
This was my first website using Bootstrap. Adobe Xd development tool was helpful to make a real website. I learned how to easily switch responsive layouts with Bootstrap.
